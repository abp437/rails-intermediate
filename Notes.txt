An action is nothing but a public method defined inside a controller, which can then be associated with a route.
This private methods defined inside controllers can't be associated with routes.

You can add a rake task inside the `lib/tasks` folder and tun it from the CLI.
Unlike migrations you can run a rake task as many times as you like from CLI.
